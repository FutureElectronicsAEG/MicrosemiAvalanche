# MicrosemiAvalanche
The Avalanche Development Kit allows developers to quickly prototype for the lowest power mid-range FPGA platform in the market. At the heart of the kit  is a 300k LE (logic element) PolarFire non-volatile FPGA from Microsemi. The PolarFire FPGA family is a cost optimized, lowest power mid-range density FPGA family with proven security and exceptional reliability.
